This file contains a program to do a simple test of the StaticNetwork network layer.

A simple 4 node network is constructed. bob is a router with connections to marci, dani, and jane. The demo should show a message being sent by marci and received by only of the two other end points.

In the demo:
marci runs AddrMsgSendApp
dani and jane run LogTargetCmd
bob doesn't run an application but otherwise has the same stack as the others.

add-node marci 1
add-node dani 1
add-node jane 1
add-node bob 3
set-network networkLayer.StaticNetwork
set-transport transportLayer.NullTransport
add-wire marci 0 bob 0
add-wire dani 0 bob 1
add-wire jane 0 bob 2
conf-net marci StaticNetDemo/marci.routes
conf-net dani  StaticNetDemo/dani.routes
conf-net jane  StaticNetDemo/jane.routes
conf-net bob   StaticNetDemo/bob.routes
power-on ALL
launch jane applicationLayer.LogSpoolApp
launch dani applicationLayer.LogSpoolApp
launch marci applicationLayer.AddrMsgSendApp 3|Hello dani! Hope this message doesn't reach jane...
